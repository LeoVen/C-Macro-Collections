# Features Overview

The C Macro Collections library comes with some core features available to all collections.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Callbacks](../cor/callbacks/index.html) | Callbacks are functions that are called when an operation is successful. These operations are divided in 5 categories (create, read, update, delete, resize). |
| [Custom Allocation](../cor/custom_allocation/index.html) | Allows you to use your own custom dynamic memory allocation functions inside the collections. |
| [Functions Table](../cor/functions_table/index.html) | A standard way to access required behaviors from the custom data types. Things like hash, comparison, freeing from memory if needed, etc. |
| [Iterators](../cor/iterators/index.html) | Iterators are a simplified access to the values of a collection. |
